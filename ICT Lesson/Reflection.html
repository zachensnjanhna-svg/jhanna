            <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to CSS</h2>
            <p>Learning about CSS and the different layers of a webpage has really helped me understand how websites are built and designed. I discovered that CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is important because it controls how web pages look and keeps the design separate from the content. This makes it easier to maintain and update websites without changing the HTML code each time. I also learned about the three main layers of a webpage, the content layer, the presentation layer, and the behavior layer. The content layer focuses on the actual information like text, images, and videos, and it reminded me that content should always be clear and accessible to everyone. The presentation layer deals with how the page looks, and I realized how CSS helps make websites more attractive, readable, and easy to navigate. The behavior layer was interesting because it involves the interactive parts of a website that make it more dynamic for users. Overall, I learned that CSS not only improves the appearance of a webpage but also makes it more organized, efficient, and user-friendly. This lesson made me appreciate how web design combines creativity and technical skills to create better online experiences.

            <h2>Lesson 2: CSS Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>Learning about CSS and how it works has given me a clearer understanding of how to style and design web pages effectively. I learned that CSS uses curly braces, colons, and semicolons to define styles, and that selectors and declarations are essential parts of its structure. The selector identifies the HTML element to be styled, while the property defines what aspect of that element will change. I also discovered that style sheets are sets of instructions that tell the browser how to display elements on a webpage. What I found interesting is that CSS helps separate the content (in HTML) from the design (in the style sheet), which makes web development more organized and easier to maintain. I also learned about the three kinds of CSS: external, embedded, and inline. External style sheets are the most efficient because they can control the design of multiple pages at once, while embedded and inline styles are used for more specific changes. Another useful concept I learned is CSS comments, which help explain code and make it easier to edit later. Overall, this lesson helped me appreciate how CSS is not just about making a website look good but also about keeping the code clean, reusable, and easy to manage. It made me realize that good web design depends on both creativity and a solid understanding of how CSS works.

            <h2>Lesson 3: Display Property </h2>
            <p>Learning about the CSS display property helped me understand how web elements are arranged and how they interact with each other on a webpage. I discovered that the display property controls how elements appear, whether they are block-level or inline, and this affects the overall layout and design. Block-level elements, like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and headings, take up the full width of a page and start on a new line, while inline elements, like  &lt;a&gt; and  &lt;span&gt;, stay on the same line as other content. I realized that knowing the difference between these two types of elements is important because it determines how I can structure and style a webpage properly. For example, I learned that inline elements can&apos;t contain block-level elements, and understanding this helps prevent layout errors in my code. I also learned that the display property can take different values, such as block, inline, none, or inherit, which allow for flexible design and control over how elements appear or hide. The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags were also interesting because they are used to group content, &lt;div&gt; for larger sections and &lt;span&gt; for smaller parts within text. Overall, this lesson made me appreciate how the display property is essential in web design, as it gives developers control over layout and organization, making web pages look clean, structured, and professional.

            <h2>Lesson 4: CSS Rules and Classes</h2>
            <p>Learning about CSS rules and classes has helped me understand how to apply styles efficiently to different elements on a webpage. I now know that a CSS rule consists of two parts&colon; a selector (which targets the element to be styled) and declarations (which define the style properties and values). I also discovered that properties in CSS are grouped into categories like fonts, colors, layouts, and lists, which makes it easier to organize and apply styles based on what I&apos;m trying to change on the page. One of the most useful things I learned is how to work with classes in CSS. Classes allow me to define reusable style rules, meaning I can apply the same style to multiple elements without writing the same code over and over again. For example, I can create a class like .highlight to give specific text a green background and white text, or I can combine multiple classes to style elements in different ways. This approach makes my code cleaner and more efficient. The example of using classes in both HTML and CSS really helped me see how flexible they are in real-world applications. Overall, understanding CSS rules and classes has improved my ability to style webpages in a more organized and reusable way, which will save me time and effort as I build more complex sites.

            <h2>Lesson 5: Class Selectors</h2>
            <p>Learning about CSS selectors helped me understand how to target and apply styles to specific elements on a webpage. I now know that CSS selectors are essential for selecting HTML elements, and they come in various types, each with its own use. The element selector is the most basic, allowing me to style HTML tags like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, or &lt;div&gt; directly. For example, using <code> p {line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px;} </code> targets all &lt;p&gt; elements and adjusts their appearance. I also learned how to use the ID selector to target unique elements on a page by using the # symbol. This is helpful when I want to style just one specific element, like <code> #header {background-color: navy; color: white;} </code> for a unique header. The class selector is similar but allows me to apply styles to multiple elements that share the same class. This makes my code more flexible and reusable. The universal selector, represented by the asterisk (*), applies styles to all elements on the page, which is useful for resetting margins or padding. The group selector lets me apply the same style to multiple elements at once by grouping them together, such as h1, h2, <code> h3 {color: darkgreen; text-align: center;}</code>. Lastly, the attribute selector allows me to target elements based on specific attributes, like styling input fields with input <code>[type="text"] {border: 1px solid gray;}</code>. Understanding these different selectors has helped me organize my CSS more effectively and apply styles with precision, making web development more efficient.

            <h2>Lesson 6: Dimensions</h2>
            <p>
Learning about CSS properties for dimensions and pseudo-classes has really expanded my understanding of how I can control the layout and interactivity of elements on a webpage. I now know that properties like visibility, width, and height help control the size and visibility of elements, which is essential for making sure everything fits and is displayed correctly. For example, using width and height lets me set the exact size of an element, while line-height helps me manage the spacing between lines of text, which improves readability. I also learned about max-width and min-height, which allow me to set limits on how large or small an element can get, making my design more flexible and responsive. Another thing that stood out to me was the concept of pseudo-classes, which define the state of an element when a user interacts with it. The common pseudo-classes for links, like :link, :visited, :hover, and :active, are especially useful for improving user experience by adding visual feedback when users interact with links. For instance, I can change the color of a link when a user hovers over it or clicks on it, which makes the website feel more dynamic and interactive. Overall, learning how to manage dimensions and use pseudo-classes has given me more tools to create clean, user-friendly, and interactive web designs.
